This is the source code to my blog.

## How it's made

### Gatsby + ![@lekoarts minimal blog starter](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog)

Modified a lot of the styling and removed some unnessecary (for my use case.) components.
Added some 3D to match the main site. Will be adding some animations in the short future.
